Cap'n Proto - Insanely Fast Data Serialization Format
Copyright 2013 Kenton Varda
http://kentonv.github.com/capnproto/

This package contains the C++ runtime implementation of Cap'n Proto.

Cap'n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based
RPC system.  Think JSON, except binary.  Or think of Google's Protocol Buffers
(http://protobuf.googlecode.com), except faster.  In fact, in benchmarks,
Cap'n Proto is INFINITY TIMES faster than Protocol Buffers.

Full installation instructions and other documentation are maintained on the
Cap'n Proto web site:
